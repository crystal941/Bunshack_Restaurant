# Bunshack_Restaurant

✨Welcome to my Bunshack_Restaurant code repository✨. 

This is a full-stack project using **React** and **TypeScript** for the frontend and **.NET 8.0** with a **SQL database** for the backend. 

This project was inspired by a newly opened small restaurant owned by a friend of mine, and serves as a practical exercise to apply the skills I have learnt from [NZMSA 2024-Phase-1](https://github.com/NZMSA/2024-Phase-1). 

## Project Overview

This repository contains the full implementation of the Bunshack_Restaurant project, showcasing various frontend and backend features. 

You can watch a Demo video here: [Demo Video]

## Highlights

One aspect I am particularly proud of is that I completed this project 100% through **self-learning**. Despite not having covered similar courses during my university studies yet, I managed to overcome the steep learning curve and build a functional full-stack application. 

Integrating the **ASP.NET Core Identity framework** for authentication as well as using **SECRET** and **workflows** to delopy was also a self-taught endeavor. Although there is always room for improvement, this project marks a significant milestone in my learning journey.
